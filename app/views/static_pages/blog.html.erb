			<h4>Clean energy shares are rallying back </h4>
			<p>
				clean energy share prices finally managed to begin a rally.
				The WilderHill Global Innovation Index, or NEX, which
				tracks the performance of 96 clean energy stocks
				worldwide, bottomed at 102.20 on 25 July 2012,
				had rallied by 18% by the end of the year, and
				continued its upswing well into 2013

			<h4>Shifting focus to developing countries</h4>
			<p>
				There was further evidence last year that renewable energy investment is gravitating to the parts of the world
                that have greatest need for additional power, and have the best natural resources for wind, solar,
                geothermal, small hydro and other technologies. In many cases, this means developing countries.
